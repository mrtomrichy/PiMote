PiMote (Work in progress)
Still to come: Grid Layout, More sensor readings, Images, Landscape/Portrait option


NOTE:
ACCELEROMETER IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL
NOT MUCH VALIDATION ADDED YET SO THERE ARE LOTS OF POTENTIAL ERRORS

    git clone https://www.github.com/radujipa/raspberrypi
    cd raspberrypi/PiMote
    sudo python setup.py install


PiMote allows you to easily use your Android phone as a remote control for your programs on your Raspberry Pi. By running a server on the Pi, your phone can connect over a local WiFi network to the Raspberry Pi to remotely trigger events and display information.
